### Firebase App Requirements

This app is intended to be a shop of anything you would like to sell. The app needs to have authentication and a database of the product you wish to sell.

[The authentication and products will be done with firebase](https://dev.to/satansdeer/firebase-react-authentication-tutorial-for-beginners-private-route-with-hooks-2ej4)

[The products should be done following the same pattern in this tutorial](https://blog.bitsrc.io/building-a-todo-app-in-react-with-firebase-and-redux-ba3ab53a671b) 



1. There should be a page for products list (or grid) 
2. The users should be able to see a product detail.
3. The users should be able to add products to a shopping cart, from the list and also from the detail
4. The shopping cart should be saved on firebase
5. There should be a checkout page for the users to "pay for the shopping cart"
6. The checkout page may have only one button that will set the shopping cart as paid on firebase and a list of the selected products that the user is paying for
7. when the user logs in, you will get for his specific shopping cart, if the shopping cart is already paid you will need to create another one
